## Installation

Nielsen App SDK is compatible with Apple iOS versions 7.0 and above.

Segment-Nielsen SDK is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Segment-Nielsen-DCR"
```

The integration relies on the the Nielsen framework, which is not available on Cocoapods. You must manually include the framework in your project. Navigate to [Nielsen's Engineering Site](https://engineeringportal.nielsen.com/docs/Main_Page) and download the following Video framework:

There will be an NDA to sign prior to accessing the download. Nielsen requires you fill out your company info and have a Nielsen representative before getting started.

Nielsen also requires the following frameworks, which must be included into Link Binary with Libraries (within app target’s Build Phases)
  - AdSupport.framework
  - SystemConfiguration.framework
  - CoreLocation.framework (Not applicable for International (Germany))
  - libsqlite3

After extracting the “NielsenAppApi.framework” from the Nielsen App SDK package and copying it to the ‘Frameworks’ folder of the Xcode project, import the Segment-Nielsen SDK header file in your `AppDelegate` :

`#import <Segment-Nielsen-DCR/SEGNielsenDCRIntegrationFactory.h>`

Then register the factory with the Segment SDK:

```
NSString *const SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY = @" ... ";
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY];

[config use:[SEGNielsenDCRIntegrationFactory instance]];

[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];
```
